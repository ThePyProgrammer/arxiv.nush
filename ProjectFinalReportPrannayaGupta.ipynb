    "The Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Department of NUS High School is a core pillar for the continued development of students in our school. With the Advanced Research Project (ARP) being a major component of our diploma, the RIE department has the immense responsibility to administrate various projects from various students. This especially important given the fact that the school gives students autonomy to participate in multiple projects with mentors from various research institutions under different time periods. However, recent years have shown that there are certain cracks forming in the database system employed by the RIE, which is incredibly problematic in administrating continuation projects, receiving project details and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that our RIE department will benefit from a RDBMS system to manage projects so that they have consistency in Project Details, allowing easier methods to search and sift through projects done by specific students, submit and receive Project Reports, Posters and ISEF/SSEF Forms, and help people get to know more about research done by Seniors and Juniors alike."

    "We design a basic database system to store the research projects of NUS High School students.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **person** is any individual with a *name* and a unique *email address*. This person must be a **student**, a **teacher** or a **research mentor**, or any set of 2-3 such roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Rationale behind the above condition: There are certain students who graduated to become teachers in NUS High, for instance Ms Han Shutong who used to teach in NUS High. Owing to the fact that NUS High is aging, we could expect more students to come back to teach, and with that, we have students who were also initially teachers. While it would also make sense for them to create a new teacher account under their new school email, it is also true that their student account will be active for quite a while. Another reason is that many projects are mentored by mentors who are, in fact, students themselves. Examples include projects mentored by PhD Candidates or even NUS Students (which, while uncommon, has happened before and is in the scope of the dataset I am currently assembling).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **student** must be either a **NUSH student** or an **external student**. A **NUSH student** has a *profile picture*, *NUSH student ID* (derived from the email), <span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\"><i>about</i></span>, a *password* and *graduation year*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **teacher** must be either a **NUSH teacher** or an **external teacher**. A **NUSH teacher** has a *profile picture* and a *password*. A **NUSH teacher** can further be a **teacher mentor** or an **administrator**, or both, but they are not tied down to any of these roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **research mentor** is defined as a researcher working in some institution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **department** is defined to store information for the teachers and the projects. There are a total of 8 departments (MA, PH, BI, CM, CS, RE, EL and HU), and each department has a unique *name* and *department id* (the aforementioned codes are the *department id* values).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **project** is any research work performed over the course of a single *year* of submission. The project is assigned a unique *project code*, is presented in a *year* and also has a non-empty *project title*, *project abstract* and *project report PDF*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **institution** is an educational or research location with a unique *name*, *initials* and *location*. This **institution** must either be an **external school**, a **research institution**, a **research organiser**, a **publisher** or any combination of the four.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **research event** is an event with a unique *event ID* and *year* pair, *name*, <span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\"><i>about</i></span>, *date range* composed of a *start date* and *end date*, *format*. A **research event** can be a **competiton**, **conference**, both or neither. A **conference** has a *doi* (Digital Object Identifier to classify papers and conferences easily. See more at http://www.doi.org/). A **competiton** has multiple *award types*.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **accomplishment** is some milestone achieved by a submission, categorised by a unique *accomplishment ID*. An accomplishment must either be an **award** or a **publication**. An **award** has a *name* and a *prize*. A **publication** has a unique *doi*. For more details regarding *doi*, see above. A **publication** must be further subdivided into either a **conference publication** or a **journal publication**. A **journal publication** has a separate *url* to the website.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **submission** is a submission to a **research event**, uniquely defined based on **research event** and a separate *code*, with a *submission title* and *submission abstract*.\n",
    "\n",
    "~~A **submission document** is a document uniquely defined by a **submission** and a separate *document filename*. The document also has a *document file*, and is also logged via a *lastUpdated* parameter, which is by default the time of update to the database.~~\n",
    "\n",
    "A **journal** is an avenue for researchers to publish their work, and is uniquely defined by *issn* (International Standard Serial Number).\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"background-color:#00ffff\">START OF RELATIONSHIPS</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "A **teacher** comes from ONE specific **department**. A **department** may have zero or more **teachers**. A **project** comes from ONE specific **department**. A **department** may have zero or more **projects**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **external school** has multiple **external teachers**, and each **external teacher** must come from one **external school**. An **external teacher** is the emergency contact of multiple **external students**, and each **external student** must have one **external teacher** as an emergency contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **research mentor** may work at multiple **research institutes** under a specific *department* with a specific *role* at a specific *office address* at each **research institute**. A **research institute** may have multiple **research mentors**, each of whom hail from specific *departments* and specific *roles*.\n",

       "        <td>Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, an area of the brain, leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty walking. Parkinson’s patients frequently exhibit the debilitating condition, freezing of gait (FoG), which is when patients cannot move their feet forward despite the intention to walk. Whilst the feet remain in place, the torso still has forward momentum, making falls very common. Several studies have reported methodologies to identify the PD patients at an early stage, such as PD scales and using inertial measurement units (IMU). However, these methods are ineffective as scales are not personalised, and the IMUs are generally big and bulky. In this study, acceleration data from the thigh of PD patients have been put through signal processing algorithms to postulate a generic freeze index, which is then run through multiple support vector machine models to analyse and therefore predict FoG events. The analysis found that vertical and horizontal lateral acceleration were the most accurate at predicting FoG. Ultimately, a small and lightweight prototype was created based on acceleration data from accelerometers placed.</td>\n",

The purpose of this project is to gain semantic understanding of the architectural design and layout of Housing Development Board (HDB) apartment interiors and of 3D exterior facades of HDB buildings. Transfer learning algorithms on semantic segmentation models have been employed to understand and analyse these two-dimensional images provided. These models require a lot of carefully annotated data, hence transfer learning on pre-trained models is used to improve the accuracy of the model. Ultimately, it is found that transfer learning with semantic segmentation is an effective way to comprehend the design and layouts of these HDB interiors and exteriors.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Annual global crustacean shell waste amounts to 6-8 million tonnes, with 1.5 million in Southeast Asia. A novel method for designing membrane filters for water purification is developed using recycled plastic and chitosan derived from shrimp shells. The active material chitosan has conventionally been used for medical applications but has demonstrated potential for nanofiltration. In this work, we successfully modified chitosan to target various types of dyes during filtration. The raw material polyethylene terephthalate is derived from recycled plastic bottles and turned into porous supports. The bio-derived chitosan polymer is modified using various anhydrides to alter its affinity to different types of molecules based on their polarity, before being coated onto the supports to form membrane filters. Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy is used to verify each step of the fabrication process as well as the successful modification of chitosan. Next, the efficiency of filtration is tested using Congo Red, Malachite Green and Methylene Blue dyes to model pollutants. The dye solutions before and after filtration were characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the filters tested, those containing unmodified chitosan or chitosan modified with propionic groups demonstrate the highest affinity to highly polar contaminants, removing up to 59.1% of Congo Red dye. Those containing chitosan modified with isobutyryl groups demonstrate the highest affinity to nonpolar contaminants, removing up to 55.1% of Malachite Green dye. This effective performance of our synthesised membranes illustrates the potential of custom-modified chitosan membranes manufactured from eco-friendly sources as highly selective filters for water purification.</td>\n",

The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is spun above a threshold angular velocity and released — a mechanism of common toys found in toy shops. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to predict the airflow around a hand helicopter from which the lift and drag acting on the hand helicopter’s blades can be obtained. Newton’s Second Law is then applied to find the hand helicopter’s equations of motion. These are solved to predict the helicopter’s trajectory and maximum height. The angle of attack, length of blades and thickness of blades are varied and their effects on the lift coefficient, drag coefficient, lift-off and maximum height are investigated. The findings offer insight into the parameters which will allow a hand helicopter to achieve its optimal maximum height. The conditions required for the hand helicopter to fly stably are also investigated and explained using the Tennis Racket Theorem.</td>\n",

The issue at hand is that many people find themselves inaccessible in legal predicaments where they would want to research the laws affecting them but would not want to read through all penal codes and laws. Similarly, this tool could also benefit lawyers to find similar cases with similar precedents. In Singapore, there exists a judiciary system that governs what acts are illegal or not. Singapore’s laws are organized under the penal code, which serves as the base document for Singapore’s laws, and acts that further extend on or overwrite sections of the penal code. The penal code and acts are well organized and consistently structured, however, the legal terms and language used are not understandable by people who are not educated in law. This creates an issue for such people who want to conduct research themselves. This is the problem we wish to address. We have partnered with Singapore’s Community Justice Center to obtain data involving citizens requesting for legal assistance. We plan to create a system that can take in the legal predicament and background information from the user’s case. We would then be giving them the section of law that the issue is covered under, previous cases and court proceedings that are like the current case, and finally the relevant acts that are related to the user’s case. This will all be packaged into a custom app to allow it to be accessible to users.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Vulnerabilities in open-source software pose dangers to users because malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise software security. To mitigate these dangers, software patches are released to fix such vulnerabilities. However, due to the volume of patches being released, users may miss out certain patches and use a vulnerable version of software unknowingly. We have thus developed a tool to automatically scan for software vulnerabilities and their associated patches in compiled, stripped binary files. Our tool uses three methods: (1) static analysis of constants, (2) emulation of the functions to analyse the output and control flow, and (3) analysis of global memory accesses. We tested this tool on six well-known vulnerabilities, including OpenSSL Heartbleed and Bash Shellshock, across three different architectures (x86, MIPS and ARM). Static analysis successfully detected all the vulnerabilities and their patches, while control flow analysis and memory access analysis had varying success. We found that static analysis is the optimal method of scanning for vulnerabilities since it is fast, simple and applicable to many vulnerabilities and architectures. However, if malicious actors have modified the constants, there is a risk of inaccurate results, so other methods might perform better. Our tool can check if software contains previously disclosed vulnerabilities, preventing hackers from compromising these systems. Our tool can also check if new software releases contain old vulnerabilities. Additionally, it can help analysts better understand stripped functions. This can be applied to other use cases such as discovering new vulnerabilities, improving the overall cybersecurity of open-source projects.</td>\n",

This combines the functions of a solar cell and a capacitor and are cost-effective rechargeable power sources that are compact and basic. This results in a wide range of application. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of 3 novel photosensitive dyes used in Dye-Sensitised Solar Cells (DSSC) while trying to optimise the fabrication of such cells. These dyes are sensitive to red to infrared wavelengths. Photocapacitors are fabricated by depositing the dyes onto a layer of TiO2 on FTO coated glass, before sealing with DN-C07 in MPN electrolyte. Various capacitor properties such as internal voltage discharge, capacitance and maximum open circuit voltage are measured. Capacitance of the cells were measured by applying external current load of 700nA. Ideal fabrication conditions are determined to maximise the open circuit voltage and charge retention. Cells developed using this method utilising dye LF15 can reach up to 0.72V potential difference and retain up to 70% 5 min after removal of light source. LF23 has shown to be able to provide the largest current density when short-circuited. These results are significant improvements from previous works. Sensitivity to infrared radiation allows usage in places impenetrable by visible light such as in internal organs and interior of electronics.</td>\n",

       "        <td>The Singapore Stone, discovered in 1819, was blown up in 1843 and remains an enigma today. Several studies have suggested the script to be Kawi, a Brahmic script used between the 8th and 16th centuries in Java and other parts of Southeast Asia. The language remains unknown but is thought to be Old Javanese, Sanskrit, or Tamil. There is great historical value in finding out what the script reads, and it is the aim of this project to offer deeper insight into this undeciphered inscription. In this research paper, an in-depth comparison of the Singapore Stone with the Calcutta Stone (1041 CE), a prominent example of a Later Kawi inscription, is performed. Brief comparisons of the Singapore Stone with other inscriptions are also done. Numerous characters on the Singapore Stone are matched to those on the Calcutta Stone. However, the Singapore Stone appeared to have a much lower frequency of diacritics and conjuncts. Such a phenomenon is anomalous and could have hindered decryption efforts thus far. Nonetheless, identification and comparison of such character signs are attempted. Overall, the two inscriptions are shown to share many stylistic similarities, suggesting that the Singapore Stone could be dated to the Later Kawi period.</td>\n",

However, these setups are extremely sensitive to external electromagnetic noise. Currently, most poMRIs employ electromagnetic shielding to reduce the external noise, though at the cost of its mobility. This motivates the use of shielding-free techniques. Here we present an approach that uses data recorded from external ambient noise coils to suppress the noise experienced by the primary radio-frequency (RF) receiver coil. Our method boasts a 30-fold noise suppression for individual measurements and a 17-fold average noise suppression for 128 randomly selected samples. Furthermore, our method only requires a calibration time of 56.5 ms, hugely improving on current deep learning methods (which usually require at least 18 minutes to train); thus, allowing for on-the-spot calibration. Our noise suppression method might significantly improve the image quality of poMRI, without the need for a shield.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Precise Geolocation data of modern cargo ships allows us to precisely plot a ship’s trajectory. In conjunction with modern machine learning techniques, this enables us to build models which extrapolates the ship’s trajectory. By forecasting the future positions of ships, it allows for the monitoring of maritime traffic, which helps to maintain situational awareness. Such data could also be used to help avoid collision between ships, or to help plan ship paths. In the past decade, models for marine trajectory prediction include sequence to sequence convolutions, long-short term memory networks (LSTM), LSTMs with attention, and most recently a transformer. Given that LSTMs and Transformers are 2 of the most successful sequence to sequence models so far, by combining them we were able to improve on the performance of the best trajectory prediction models. When a DenseNet ran on the transformer output with a skip connection, we achieved a sizable improvement compared to the current best model TrAISformer. To further test the utility of our model, we trained this model on data from Singapore in 2021. We did the same with previous models from literature review and compared their results. Amongst the previous models, TrAISformer performed the best, with an average distance between true position and predicted position of the ship after 3 hours being 1.95 nautical miles. Our model performed approximately 57% better as compared to TrAISformer. Across multiple datasets, we are consistently able to better predict maritime trajectory than previous work.</td>\n",

This has made research in the political landscape difficult. As such, our research seeks to derive a characteristic formula of those family dynamics through a macro application of graph theory. Through the construction of a family tree of the French royal lineage along with analysis and observation of a large dataset of historical events, a skeleton was developed using key data points within our samples. The skeleton is then refined by including more samples and scenarios, resulting in the distance formula R. It is capable of giving a numerical distance between any person A and B within a family tree, which would determine how closely related they were, and from there able to make predictions for succession or related scenarios. It is found that the formula was able to accurately help break down and shed light on the succession dispute of King Charles IV in 1328, the primary reason for the Hundred Years War between the English and the French. Overall the R distance formula was of good accuracy and has met our research goals. It would be capable of reflecting and simulating historical events with reasonable accuracy, and thus would provide insight into fundamental dynamics within the mediaeval royal families. It is believed that this formula could form the foundation for future more complex and flexible formulas, and thus is a step closer to describing what seemed to be a chaotic phenomenon.</td>\n",

       "        <td>During the pandemic, the pressures on the healthcare industry have greatly increased, with hospitals running low on resources and manpower. A common task that doctors and nurses have to perform is assessing the patient’s suitability for intubation, which involves measuring the thyromental distance (the distance between the chin and the thyroid). We propose using deep learning models to exploit the similarity of human faces to speed up the measurement of this distance. In addition, we also use our models to attempt to predict the entire geometry of the human face, through the use of a face mesh and create a data generation pipeline to generate synthetic renders of human faces. We believe that our method can also be used for predicting other facial features which are different from those we have investigated. Human faces are remarkably similar in global properties, including size, aspect ratio, and location of main features. Still, they can vary considerably in detail across individuals, gender, race, or due to facial expressions. We propose a novel method for 3D shape recovery of faces that exploits the similarity of faces. Our approach obtains as input a single image and uses classical reconstruction methods from single images. Recent methods circumvent these requirements by representing input faces as combinations (of hundreds) of stored 3D models. We generated our own synthetic data using flame and trained our data based on that.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Klebsiella pneumoniae is a highly prevalent, multi-drug resistant pathogen which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited range of treatment options available. A  potential alternative to traditional treatment would be the use of bacteriophages (phages). Recent years have seen a renewed interest in phages due to their natural abundancy, low cost, rapid replication times and potential for non-intrusive therapy. Here, we explore the possibility of employing phages rather than traditional antimicrobial drugs to treat K. pneumoniae infections. 17 novel phages were isolated from local and overseas sources and purified from K. pneumoniae samples and host range analysis was performed to determine their potential to be used in phage therapy.  ΦBZ was notably found to be able to kill a wide range of 25 unique K. pneumoniae strains. To improve killing against phage-resistant strains, we further investigated the bactericidal efficacy of a novel phage-antibiotic cocktail, consisting of ΦBZ, ΦSP21, ΦFAJ16 and fosfomycin. This combination was shown to work synergistically, markedly decreasing bacterial load by 7.8 log cycles (p &lt; 0.001) at fosfomycin concentration of 512μg/ml compared to treatment with ΦBZ alone after 24h. Our cocktail was able to significantly check the emergence of phage-resistant mutants compared to ΦBZ alone. Hence, our results clearly demonstrate the potential of our novel phage-antibiotic cocktail in treating K. pneumoniae infections in patients who do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. </td>\n",

       "        <td>Machine learning has seen increasing usage in the field of cybersecurity, particularly for the classification of malware. Visualization-based techniques have been proposed as a means of binary representation, often being used in deep learning frameworks which rely on architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often producing high accuracy models. This paper aims to explore the interpretability of such a classifier, using localization maps and adversarial samples to identify areas and elements of the binary that the classifier deems high importance in the classification process. Furthermore, a novel adversarial attack is developed which relies on the insertion of opaque predicates into a malicious binary to evade detection. We show that visualization-based malware deep learning classifiers are easily evaded, with the novel attack having a 100\\% evasion rate with an average filesize increase of 0.43452\\%. Furthermore, analysis of localization maps show that CNNs are unable to identify regions which contribute to the malicious behaviour of a binary and often incorrectly identify easily modifiable non-executable regions such as null-byte padding as high importance features in the classification process. We thus recommend the discontinuation of use of visualization-based deep learning classifiers due to low interpretability and ease of evasion, contrary to recent research output which claims its robustness.</td>\n",

As discovering AMPs is costly and time inefficient, deep learning has been proposed to accelerate the process by suggesting potential AMPs before they undergo wet lab validation. PepGAN is one such framework to train a peptide sequence Generator. In this study, we build on PepGAN and substitute our own molecular fingerprint-based XGBoost model as the activity predictor. We use transfer learning to train an activity predictor that identifies peptides effective against the \\emph{Enterococcus faecalis}(EF) species of bacteria. We find that the positive dataset passed to PepGAN has a far greater impact on the performance compared to PepGAN&#x27;s activity predictor, and find that 4843 of the 9937 peptides generated are antimicrobial against the EF strain at or above 70\\% confidence level. In future work, we hope to do wet-lab testing to determine the actual efficacy of the suggested peptides.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Game engines are tools commonly used by software developers to create dynamic applications, containing ready-made functions that clients can use. However, most available game engines have complex user interfaces that use a separate window and have multiple parts. Additionally, many game engines are specialised for specific genres. These functionalities are useful for large projects, but consumes unnecessary processing power and introduces unnecessary complication for smaller projects or demos. We create a novel game engine with a dynamic link library (DLL) structure named LEDA, which allows for increased portability of the engine and ease of linking for smaller projects, as well as providing a greater degree of simplicity for new developers without a separate interface to go through. LEDA taking this structure also allows for direct integration of engine functions in game code, making it useful for beginners learning the interactions between the game engine and logic. The game engine uses the OpenGL library for graphics support and contains multiple systems to support users, including functions for physics, collision detection, and reading input. We also use a component-based composition technique to design game objects, which makes the engine more modular and easier to refactor, supporting continued updates or modification. This engine will provide a more accessible option for newer developers who are beginning to create their own applications without being intimidated by larger, commercial-use game engines.</td>\n",

We believe this is the first work to make use of GNNs to find the longest simple path. We generated a custom dataset of graphs and use dynamic programming solvers to find the solution on small randomly generated graphs. We train the neural network on this dataset and combined it with the beam search algorithm to predict the longest simple path.

In this paper we develop DEQBert, a novel deep equilibrium implementation of the BERT language model. We base DEQBert on the open-source HuggingFace Transformers library, evaluate its performance against established benchmarks, and publicly release the pretrained weights. Training DEQ language models present unique sets of challenges, and while DEQBert does not match the performance of BERT, we hope that the development of a codebase and pretrained model encourages further exploration and improvement of DEQ language models.

       "        <td>The Apollonius’ problem in 2D involves finding circles that are tangent to three given objects. This problem has been studied extensively for centuries, and many solutions have been proposed. In the past, solutions to this problem have mainly relied on compass and ruler constructions. However, these methods can become complex and time-consuming, especially when dealing with non-trivial and 3D cases. In this paper, we propose such a framework and demonstrate its versatility and power in solving for tangency in non-trivial cases. Our approach is based on the use of algebraic equations to express the tangency conditions between circles and objects. Specifically, we represent the three given objects as algebraic surfaces, and the circle as an algebraic curve. By equating the gradients of the surfaces and the curve, we obtain a system of algebraic equations that can be solved to find the circle that is tangent to the objects. Using this framework, we solve for tangency in novel cases, including cubic and hyperbolic cones. In particular, we demonstrate that our approach can handle cases where the objects are not smoothly curved, such as in the case of cones with cusps or self-intersections. We provide explicit algebraic solutions for these cases, which can be used to efficiently compute the radius and position of the tangent circle. In addition to solving for tangency, we also investigate the efficiency of sphere packing in these novel cases. Sphere packing refers to the arrangement of spheres in a given space such that they do not overlap. In the context of Apollonius’ problem, sphere packing can be used to generate a gasket that is tangent to the three given objects. Our analysis reveals that the efficiency of sphere packing can vary significantly depending on the specific geometry of the objects involved. In some cases, it is possible to achieve perfect packing, while in others, significant gaps may remain.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Computed tomography is a imaging technique that makes use of particles such as x-ray photons to examine the interiors of objects. It has become an invaluable tool in the modern world as it is widely used in CT scanners in hospitals. However, due to limitations in equipment or hazards of high dosage, the dosage that can be safely delivered is limited. This results in reduced image quality. Improving the quality of such low-dose CT scans can not only reduce the potential health risks posed to patients, but it can also reduce the equipment costs and time taken, allowing for CT scans to be utilized much more liberally. In this project, we develop novel deep learning methods for low dose computed tomography using Transformers. Our model, CTransformer is trained on real-world data and extensive experiments are carried out to show that it outperforms all existing traditional methods. It also achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the LoDoPaB low-dose CT challenge, showing this approach has great potential. More importantly, we show that deep learning based reconstruction techniques can function well even with extremely low dosages, with our model achieving a peak-signal-to-noise-ratio of 32.24 and structural similarity index of 0.781 even when 90% of sinograms are masked.</td>\n",

Based on dynamic analysis reports, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are extracted as a data source for statistical features, have allowed for effective malware detection. However, existing works neglect certain critical information about the API calls when implementing feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector, taking into account not only API calls and their arguments but also other statistical features such as return values, and global statistics. Due to the diversity of API calls in terms of the number of arguments, we adopt hash functions to construct a fix-sized feature vector, thus facilitating the design and development of a deep learning model for malware detection. We experiment with various deep-learning models to come up with an optimal model for our feature vector. Experiments show that our solution outperforms many baseline state-of-the-art malware detectors, therefore proving the effectiveness of our feature vector and model.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the substantia nigra, a region in the brain. It causes many hindrances to activities of daily living (ADL). A debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait (FoG), where patients are unable to move forward despite intention of walking. The forward momentum of the torso can often lead to patients falling, causing serious medical consequences. Prior work has explored the use of gait tests, medical questionnaires and inertial measurement units to predict FoG. In this research, work has been done to perform a comprehensive review of various input formats, signal processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to predict such FoG events. A novel method for image representation via autoscaling and RGB pixelation has been introduced, in addition to raw signal data and the Moore-Bachlin algorithm for Freeze Indices. We find that a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) performs the best on scaled images, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.50% and sensitivity of 99.65%. We integrate this model into an Android application which can be used by patients and doctors to predict and track freeze events over a period of time. This can help doctors diagnose patients and gauge the severity of the disease, so as to prescribe medication.</td>\n",

However, when the liquid is left on the rod for a sufficiently long time, fluid will accumulate in bands around the cylinder. When these bands reach a sufficiently large amplitude, the fluid will drain off the rod. While previous literature have explored the formation and growth of these bands, none have explored the conditions under which the fluid in these bands will drain. In this paper, we make use of a linear stability analysis to find the growth rate of the band and hence, the time taken for the bands to reach the critical amplitude. We verify this approximation with full 3D simulations. Afterwards, this is used to plot a phase plot of the phase of the fluid at a certain point in time which is also experimentally verified.</td>\n",

With this, we find the transient motion of a single particle and plot the potential that particle to find its equilibrium radius. The positions of the equilibria are visualised using a bifurcation diagram. Furthermore, we make use of the Baynes-Hutt algorithm to construct a novel n-body simulation of the particles&#x27; motion, accounting for the particle&#x27;s mutual attraction due to the Cheerios effect.

The Rayleigh disk refers to a small disk suspended from a light thread that placed in an acoustic field, which will tend to align itself to the incoming wavefronts. We considered two theoretical models to model the dynamics of the Rayleigh disk, a numerical and an analytic method. We also studied the effect of varying certain parameters, such as radius and initial angle of the disk as well as the torsional constant of the string. We show that the models are accurate for all these parameters by comparing the model predictions with experimental data. We investigated the accuracy of the Rayleigh disk by using final angle as a means of predicting the intensity of the sound played. The impact of parameters on the accuracy is also modelled and experimentally verified using statistical methods, such as the R2 score. We found that the Rayleigh disk is accurate for quite a large range of intensities, even when parameters are not optimal. The findings presented in this work help us to gain a deeper understanding of how the Rayleigh disk functions and its accuracy as a practical tool.</td>\n",

However, this generally involves the intensely laborious task of manually analysing photometric data, making large-scale classification difficult. While a few semi-automated algorithms to aid in this task have been developed, they both struggle with noisy data and are closed source, making their application limited. By analysing variations in the Eclipse Timings of known Eclipsing Binaries (EBs) using filtering and signal processing techniques, we develop a noise-resistant semi-automated system to screen EBs for potential trinary companions. We additionally run our system on the Kepler EB Catalogue v3, and detect the presence of 401 trinary star candidates out of a dataset of 2865 stellar systems. Our algorithm allows for rapid processing of EBs, and enables the large-scale identification of trinary stars.

       "        <td>In aquaculture farming, uneven larval growth is often observed and sorting at the early stages is necessary to prevent cannibalism and uneven product size. However, current sorting methods are generally slow, labour-intensive, and inaccurate. Here, we created a novel mechanism called active matter cytometry (AMC), which accurately sizes and sorts zebrafish larvae at the millimeter scale, drawing inspiration from cell cytometry. The AMC performs 3 functions – channeling larvae into tubing, predicting the length of larvae with photomicrosensors, and directing them to the correct sorting point with a solenoid actuator. This design involved the use of 3D printed parts to customize some commercially available components. Our results show that the sensors are capable of predicting the larval length with a median accuracy of 95.6% as they move headfirst through tubing. When tasked to separate zebrafish larvae born 9 days apart, we observed a 90% accuracy and larvae remained alive and intact. Our AMC shows great potential to be scaled up for commercial use in aquaculture farms, and could be applied to larvae of various types of fish. Furthermore, it can support laboratory work such as polymerase chain reaction testing in zebrafish. With modifications to the sensing component, we can also utilize our design for high-quality imaging of larvae and make use of machine learning for other classification criteria.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Dynamic malware analysis, which has been a major field in malware analysis and detection, involves executing the malware in a controlled environment and observing its behavior. Based on dynamic analysis reports, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are extracted as a data source for statistical features, have allowed for effective malware detection. However, existing works neglect certain critical information about the API calls when constructing feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector, taking into account not only API calls and their arguments but also other statistical features such as return values, and global statistics. Due to the diversity of API calls in terms of the number of arguments, we adopt hash functions to construct a fix-sized feature vector, thus facilitating the design and development of machine learning and deep learning models for malware detection. We experiment with various deep-learning models and we adopt a genetic algorithm for parameter tuning to come up with an optimal model for our feature vector. Experiments on a real dataset of $15000$ samples show that our solution outperforms many baseline state-of-the-art malware detectors in various performance metrics such as accuracy, and false positive or false negative rate, thus proving the effectiveness of our feature vector and detection model.</td>\n",

The purpose of this project is to gain semantic understanding of the architectural design and layout of Housing Development Board (HDB) apartment interiors and of 3D exterior facades of HDB buildings. Transfer learning algorithms on semantic segmentation models have been employed to understand and analyse these two-dimensional images provided. These models require a lot of carefully annotated data, hence transfer learning on pre-trained models is used to improve the accuracy of the model.

However, these setups are extremely sensitive to external electromagnetic noise. Currently, most poMRIs employ electromagnetic shielding to reduce the external noise, though at the cost of its mobility. This motivates the use of shielding-free techniques. Here we present an approach that uses data recorded from external ambient noise coils to suppress the noise experienced by the primary radio-frequency (RF) receiver coil. Our method boasts a 30-fold noise suppression for individual measurements and a 17-fold average noise suppression for 128 randomly selected samples. Furthermore, our method only requires a calibration time of 56.5 ms, hugely improving on current deep learning methods (which usually require at least 18 minutes to train); thus, allowing for on-the-spot calibration. Our noise suppression method might significantly improve the image quality of poMRI, without the need for a shield.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the substantia nigra, a region in the brain. It causes many hindrances to activities of daily living (ADL). A debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait (FoG), where patients are unable to move forward despite intention of walking. The forward momentum of the torso can often lead to patients falling, causing serious medical consequences. Prior work has explored the use of gait tests, medical questionnaires and inertial measurement units to predict FoG. In this research, work has been done to perform a comprehensive review of various input formats, signal processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to predict such FoG events. A novel method for image representation via autoscaling and RGB pixelation has been introduced, in addition to raw signal data and the Moore-Bachlin algorithm for Freeze Indices. We find that a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) performs the best on scaled images, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.50% and sensitivity of 99.65%. We integrate this model into an Android application which can be used by patients and doctors to predict and track freeze events over a period of time. This can help doctors diagnose patients and gauge the severity of the disease, so as to prescribe medication.</td>\n",

In this paper we develop DEQBert, a novel deep equilibrium implementation of the BERT language model. We base DEQBert on the open-source HuggingFace Transformers library, evaluate its performance against established benchmarks, and publicly release the pretrained weights. Training DEQ language models present unique sets of challenges, and while DEQBert does not match the performance of BERT, we hope that the development of a codebase and pretrained model encourages further exploration and improvement of DEQ language models.

The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is spun above a threshold angular velocity and released — a mechanism of common toys found in toy shops. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to predict the airflow around a hand helicopter from which the lift and drag acting on the hand helicopter’s blades can be obtained. Newton’s Second Law is then applied to find the hand helicopter’s equations of motion. These are solved to predict the helicopter’s trajectory and maximum height. The angle of attack, length of blades and thickness of blades are varied and their effects on the lift coefficient, drag coefficient, lift-off and maximum height are investigated. The findings offer insight into the parameters which will allow a hand helicopter to achieve its optimal maximum height.

       "        <td>Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task used to identify specific regions of interest for virtual agents and autonomous robots or vehicles, specifically by assigning a class to every pixel of a given image. These class allocations require computational perception of nearby pixels, which hence requires very highly detailed algorithms and larger segmentation models to be achieved. The purpose of this project is to gain semantic understanding of the architectural design and layout of Housing Development Board (HDB) apartment interiors and of 3D exterior facades of HDB buildings. Transfer learning algorithms on semantic segmentation models have been employed to understand and analyse these two-dimensional images provided. These models require a lot of carefully annotated data, hence transfer learning on pre-trained models is used to improve the accuracy of the model. Ultimately, it is found that transfer learning with semantic segmentation is an effective way to comprehend the design and layouts of these HDB interiors and exteriors.</td>\n",

       "        <td>In aquaculture farming, uneven larval growth is often observed and sorting at the early stages is necessary to prevent cannibalism and uneven product size. However, current sorting methods are generally slow, labour-intensive, and inaccurate. Here, we created a novel mechanism called active matter cytometry (AMC), which accurately sizes and sorts zebrafish larvae at the millimeter scale, drawing inspiration from cell cytometry. The AMC performs 3 functions – channeling larvae into tubing, predicting the length of larvae with photomicrosensors, and directing them to the correct sorting point with a solenoid actuator. This design involved the use of 3D printed parts to customize some commercially available components. Our results show that the sensors are capable of predicting the larval length with a median accuracy of 95.6\\% as they move headfirst through tubing. When tasked to separate zebrafish larvae born 9 days apart, we observed a 90\\% accuracy and larvae remained alive and intact. Our AMC shows great potential to be scaled up for commercial use in aquaculture farms, and could be applied to larvae of various types of fish. Furthermore, it can support laboratory work such as polymerase chain reaction testing in zebrafish. With modifications to the sensing component, we can also utilize our design for high-quality imaging of larvae and make use of machine learning for other classification criteria.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Portable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (poMRI) setups allow for point-of-care imaging, which can greatly enrich paramedic services. However, these setups are extremely sensitive to external electromagnetic noise. Currently, most poMRIs employ electromagnetic shielding to reduce the external noise, though at the cost of its mobility. This motivates the use of shielding-free techniques. Here we present an approach that uses data recorded from external ambient noise coils to suppress the noise experienced by the primary radio-frequency (RF) receiver coil. Our method boasts a 30-fold noise suppression for individual measurements and a 17-fold average noise suppression for 128 randomly selected samples. Furthermore, our method only requires a calibration time of 56.5 ms, hugely improving on current deep learning methods (which usually require at least 18 minutes to train); thus, allowing for on-the-spot calibration. Our noise suppression method might significantly improve the image quality of poMRI, without the need for a shield.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Computed tomography is a imaging technique that makes use of particles such as x-ray photons to examine the interiors of objects. It has become an invaluable tool in the modern world as it is widely used in CT scanners in hospitals. However, due to limitations in equipment or hazards of high dosage, the dosage that can be safely delivered is limited. This results in reduced image quality. Improving the quality of such low-dose CT scans can not only reduce the potential health risks posed to patients, but it can also reduce the equipment costs and time taken, allowing for CT scans to be utilized much more liberally. In this project, we develop novel deep learning methods for low dose computed tomography using Transformers. Our model, CTransformer is trained on real-world data and extensive experiments are carried out to show that it outperforms all existing traditional methods. It also achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the LoDoPaB low-dose CT challenge, showing this approach has great potential. More importantly, we show that deep learning based reconstruction techniques can function well even with extremely low dosages, with our model achieving a peak-signal-to-noise-ratio of 32.24 and structural similarity index of 0.781 even when 90% of sinograms are masked.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the substantia nigra, a region in the brain. It causes many hindrances to activities of daily living (ADL). A debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait (FoG), where patients are unable to move forward despite intention of walking. The forward momentum of the torso can often lead to patients falling, causing serious medical consequences. Prior work has explored the use of gait tests, medical questionnaires and inertial measurement units to predict FoG. In this research, work has been done to perform a comprehensive review of various input formats, signal processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to predict such FoG events. A novel method for image representation via autoscaling and RGB pixelation has been introduced, in addition to raw signal data and the Moore-Bachlin algorithm for Freeze Indices. We find that a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) performs the best on scaled images, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.50% and sensitivity of 99.65%. We integrate this model into an Android application which can be used by patients and doctors to predict and track freeze events over a period of time. This can help doctors diagnose patients and gauge the severity of the disease, so as to prescribe medication.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Klebsiella pneumoniae is a highly prevalent, multi-drug resistant pathogen which is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates due to the limited range of treatment options available. A  potential alternative to traditional treatment would be the use of bacteriophages (phages). Recent years have seen a renewed interest in phages due to their natural abundancy, low cost, rapid replication times and potential for non-intrusive therapy. Here, we explore the possibility of employing phages rather than traditional antimicrobial drugs to treat K. pneumoniae infections. 17 novel phages were isolated from local and overseas sources and purified from K. pneumoniae samples and host range analysis was performed to determine their potential to be used in phage therapy.  ΦBZ was notably found to be able to kill a wide range of 25 unique K. pneumoniae strains. To improve killing against phage-resistant strains, we further investigated the bactericidal efficacy of a novel phage-antibiotic cocktail, consisting of ΦBZ, ΦSP21, ΦFAJ16 and fosfomycin. This combination was shown to work synergistically, markedly decreasing bacterial load by 7.8 log cycles (p &lt; 0.001) at fosfomycin concentration of 512μg/ml compared to treatment with ΦBZ alone after 24h. Our cocktail was able to significantly check the emergence of phage-resistant mutants compared to ΦBZ alone. Hence, our results clearly demonstrate the potential of our novel phage-antibiotic cocktail in treating K. pneumoniae infections in patients who do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. </td>\n",

As discovering AMPs is costly and time inefficient, deep learning has been proposed to accelerate the process by suggesting potential AMPs before they undergo wet lab validation. PepGAN is one such framework to train a peptide sequence Generator. In this study, we build on PepGAN and substitute our own molecular fingerprint-based XGBoost model as the activity predictor. We use transfer learning to train an activity predictor that identifies peptides effective against the \\emph{Enterococcus faecalis}(EF) species of bacteria. We find that the positive dataset passed to PepGAN has a far greater impact on the performance compared to PepGAN&#x27;s activity predictor, and find that 4843 of the 9937 peptides generated are antimicrobial against the EF strain at or above 70\\% confidence level.

       "        <td>Annual global crustacean shell waste amounts to 6-8 million tonnes, with 1.5 million in Southeast Asia. A novel method for designing membrane filters for water purification is developed using recycled plastic and chitosan derived from shrimp shells. The active material chitosan has conventionally been used for medical applications but has demonstrated potential for nanofiltration. In this work, we successfully modified chitosan to target various types of dyes during filtration. The raw material polyethylene terephthalate is derived from recycled plastic bottles and turned into porous supports. The bio-derived chitosan polymer is modified using various anhydrides to alter its affinity to different types of molecules based on their polarity, before being coated onto the supports to form membrane filters. Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy is used to verify each step of the fabrication process as well as the successful modification of chitosan. Next, the efficiency of filtration is tested using Congo Red, Malachite Green and Methylene Blue dyes to model pollutants. The dye solutions before and after filtration were characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the filters tested, those containing unmodified chitosan or chitosan modified with propionic groups demonstrate the highest affinity to highly polar contaminants, removing up to 59.1% of Congo Red dye. Those containing chitosan modified with isobutyryl groups demonstrate the highest affinity to nonpolar contaminants, removing up to 55.1% of Malachite Green dye. This effective performance of our synthesised membranes illustrates the potential of custom-modified chitosan membranes manufactured from eco-friendly sources as highly selective filters for water purification.</td>\n",

This combines the functions of a solar cell and a capacitor and are cost-effective rechargeable power sources that are compact and basic. This results in a wide range of application. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of 3 novel photosensitive dyes used in Dye-Sensitised Solar Cells (DSSC) while trying to optimise the fabrication of such cells. These dyes are sensitive to red to infrared wavelengths. Photocapacitors are fabricated by depositing the dyes onto a layer of TiO2 on FTO coated glass, before sealing with DN-C07 in MPN electrolyte. Various capacitor properties such as internal voltage discharge, capacitance and maximum open circuit voltage are measured. Capacitance of the cells were measured by applying external current load of 700nA. Ideal fabrication conditions are determined to maximise the open circuit voltage and charge retention. Cells developed using this method utilising dye LF15 can reach up to 0.72V potential difference and retain up to 70% 5 min after removal of light source. LF23 has shown to be able to provide the largest current density when short-circuited. These results are significant improvements from previous works. Sensitivity to infrared radiation allows usage in places impenetrable by visible light such as in internal organs and interior of electronics.</td>\n",

This has made research in the political landscape difficult. As such, our research seeks to derive a characteristic formula of those family dynamics through a macro application of graph theory. Through the construction of a family tree of the French royal lineage along with analysis and observation of a large dataset of historical events, a skeleton was developed using key data points within our samples. The skeleton is then refined by including more samples and scenarios, resulting in the distance formula R. It is capable of giving a numerical distance between any person A and B within a family tree, which would determine how closely related they were, and from there able to make predictions for succession or related scenarios. It is found that the formula was able to accurately help break down and shed light on the succession dispute of King Charles IV in 1328, the primary reason for the Hundred Years War between the English and the French. Overall the R distance formula was of good accuracy and has met our research goals. It would be capable of reflecting and simulating historical events with reasonable accuracy, and thus would provide insight into fundamental dynamics within the mediaeval royal families. It is believed that this formula could form the foundation for future more complex and flexible formulas, and thus is a step closer to describing what seemed to be a chaotic phenomenon.</td>\n",

However, this generally involves the intensely laborious task of manually analysing photometric data, making large-scale classification difficult. While a few semi-automated algorithms to aid in this task have been developed, they both struggle with noisy data and are closed source, making their application limited. By analysing variations in the Eclipse Timings of known Eclipsing Binaries (EBs) using filtering and signal processing techniques, we develop a noise-resistant semi-automated system to screen EBs for potential trinary companions. We additionally run our system on the Kepler EB Catalogue v3, and detect the presence of 401 trinary star candidates out of a dataset of 2865 stellar systems. Our algorithm allows for rapid processing of EBs, and enables the large-scale identification of trinary stars.

In this paper we develop DEQBert, a novel deep equilibrium implementation of the BERT language model. We base DEQBert on the open-source HuggingFace Transformers library, evaluate its performance against established benchmarks, and publicly release the pretrained weights. Training DEQ language models present unique sets of challenges, and while DEQBert does not match the performance of BERT, we hope that the development of a codebase and pretrained model encourages further exploration and improvement of DEQ language models.

We generated a custom dataset of graphs and use dynamic programming solvers to find the solution on small randomly generated graphs. We train the neural network on this dataset and combined it with the beam search algorithm to predict the longest simple path.

Acute respiratory infection is the most common reason for a telemedicine consultation. Throat examination is important to diagnose bacterial pharyngitis, but this is challenging for doctors during a telemedicine consultation. A solution is for patients to upload images of their throat to a web application.<br><br>Aim: The aim is to develop a deep learning model for the automated diagnosis of exudative pharyngitis. Thereafter, the model will be deployed online.<br><br>Methods: I used 343 throat images (139 with exudative pharyngitis and 204 without pharyngitis) in the study. ImageDataGenerator augmented the training data. Transfer learning (pre-trained on ImageNet data) was used. The convolutional neural network models of MobileNetV3, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 were implemented to train the dataset, with hyper-parameter tuning.<br><br>Results: All 3 models trained successfully with loss and training loss decreasing, and accuracy and training accuracy increasing with successive epochs. The EfficientNetB0 model achieved the highest accuracy at 95.5%, compared to MobileNetV3 (80.6%) and ResNet50 (76.1%). The EfficientNetB0 model was also able to achieve a high precision (1.00), recall (0.89) and f1-score (0.94).<br><br>Discussion: I have trained a deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 that can diagnose exudative pharyngitis.

In conjunction with modern machine learning techniques, this enables us to build models which extrapolates the ship’s trajectory. By forecasting the future positions of ships, it allows for the monitoring of maritime traffic, which helps to maintain situational awareness. Such data could also be used to help avoid collision between ships, or to help plan ship paths. In the past decade, models for marine trajectory prediction include sequence to sequence convolutions, long-short term memory networks (LSTM), LSTMs with attention, and most recently a transformer. Given that LSTMs and Transformers are 2 of the most successful sequence to sequence models so far, by combining them we were able to improve on the performance of the best trajectory prediction models. When a DenseNet ran on the transformer output with a skip connection, we achieved a sizable improvement compared to the current best model TrAISformer. To further test the utility of our model, we trained this model on data from Singapore in 2021. We did the same with previous models from literature review and compared their results. Amongst the previous models, TrAISformer performed the best, with an average distance between true position and predicted position of the ship after 3 hours being 1.95 nautical miles. Our model performed approximately 57% better as compared to TrAISformer. Across multiple datasets, we are consistently able to better predict maritime trajectory than previous work.</td>\n",

To mitigate these dangers, software patches are released to fix such vulnerabilities. However, due to the volume of patches being released, users may miss out certain patches and use a vulnerable version of software unknowingly. We have thus developed a tool to automatically scan for software vulnerabilities and their associated patches in compiled, stripped binary files. Our tool uses three methods: (1) static analysis of constants, (2) emulation of the functions to analyse the output and control flow, and (3) analysis of global memory accesses. We tested this tool on six well-known vulnerabilities, including OpenSSL Heartbleed and Bash Shellshock, across three different architectures (x86, MIPS and ARM). Static analysis successfully detected all the vulnerabilities and their patches, while control flow analysis and memory access analysis had varying success. We found that static analysis is the optimal method of scanning for vulnerabilities since it is fast, simple and applicable to many vulnerabilities and architectures. However, if malicious actors have modified the constants, there is a risk of inaccurate results, so other methods might perform better. Our tool can check if software contains previously disclosed vulnerabilities, preventing hackers from compromising these systems. Our tool can also check if new software releases contain old vulnerabilities. Additionally, it can help analysts better understand stripped functions. This can be applied to other use cases such as discovering new vulnerabilities, improving the overall cybersecurity of open-source projects.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Game engines are tools commonly used by software developers to create dynamic applications, containing ready-made functions that clients can use. However, most available game engines have complex user interfaces that use a separate window and have multiple parts. Additionally, many game engines are specialised for specific genres. These functionalities are useful for large projects, but consumes unnecessary processing power and introduces unnecessary complication for smaller projects or demos. We create a novel game engine with a dynamic link library (DLL) structure named LEDA, which allows for increased portability of the engine and ease of linking for smaller projects, as well as providing a greater degree of simplicity for new developers without a separate interface to go through. LEDA taking this structure also allows for direct integration of engine functions in game code, making it useful for beginners learning the interactions between the game engine and logic. The game engine uses the OpenGL library for graphics support and contains multiple systems to support users, including functions for physics, collision detection, and reading input. We also use a component-based composition technique to design game objects, which makes the engine more modular and easier to refactor, supporting continued updates or modification. This engine will provide a more accessible option for newer developers who are beginning to create their own applications without being intimidated by larger, commercial-use game engines.</td>\n",

       "        <td>Machine learning has seen increasing usage in the field of cybersecurity, particularly for the classification of malware. Visualization-based techniques have been proposed as a means of binary representation, often being used in deep learning frameworks which rely on architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often producing high accuracy models. This paper aims to explore the interpretability of such a classifier, using localization maps and adversarial samples to identify areas and elements of the binary that the classifier deems high importance in the classification process. Furthermore, a novel adversarial attack is developed which relies on the insertion of opaque predicates into a malicious binary to evade detection. We show that visualization-based malware deep learning classifiers are easily evaded, with the novel attack having a 100\\% evasion rate with an average filesize increase of 0.43452\\%. Furthermore, analysis of localization maps show that CNNs are unable to identify regions which contribute to the malicious behaviour of a binary and often incorrectly identify easily modifiable non-executable regions such as null-byte padding as high importance features in the classification process. We thus recommend the discontinuation of use of visualization-based deep learning classifiers due to low interpretability and ease of evasion, contrary to recent research output which claims its robustness.</td>\n",

    "With the onset of this project, I came in with the express purpose of designing something that would help the school in a meaningful manner, similar to my seniors (Zewei and Hee Lai specifically). In that way, working on this project has allowed me to understand the intricacies of not just standard database systems, but also just the utter complexity of the Research Department's database. When I entered, I had only some experience with SQL Databases, having designed SQL Databases for BuildingBloCS back in 2021 and worked on NUSH.link (which used PostgreSQL and, at one point, MySQL). Most of my experience in database design had been with the Android Module, where we used Firebase and the NoSQL techniques there. Then, we were more willing to make documents with differing properties, and we left most of the interpretation to the development side. Hence, coming into SQL, I realise that there are methodologies in place to ensure data consistency via SQL, which has significantly lowered down the number of checks I need to work on. However, with that, it also increases the number of checks I need to implement for insertion, as SQL is a lot more strict. Hence, development usually shifts from reading code to insertion. However, it is pretty clear that while both have their perks, SQL is still an important skill that will help me in the future, when I need to design platform for other projects and events. Beyond this, I believe that I have managed my time pretty well for this project (at least compared to previous ones) because I had a clear roadmap from the get-go. This aided me in striving for the best, and also allowed to make good use of the help in class because I actually had a platform ready. Overall, I am happy with what I’ve made, even noting all the Work-in-Progress features that require additional work. I hope to be able to pitch this to the school, and work with Jed to design a great platform for the school’s RIE department."
