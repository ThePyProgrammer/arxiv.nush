STYau,2022,Comp-129,Law Identification And Classification Text Bot Using Modified Elbow Method And Bidirectional Encoder Representation From Transformers,"Law is very important to the public. People often do not have the time and/or the knowledge to conduct legal research by themselves. Consultation with lawyers may prove too expensive. It costs upwards of $100 per hour to get a commercial lawyer in Singapore alone. Hence, we plan to utilize AI to open an avenue for free, accessible law help. The issue at hand is that many people find themselves inaccessible in legal predicaments where they would want to research the laws affecting them but would not want to read through all penal codes and laws. Similarly, this tool could also benefit lawyers to find similar cases with similar precedents. In Singapore, there exists a judiciary system that governs what acts are illegal or not. Singapore’s laws are organized under the penal code, which serves as the base document for Singapore’s laws, and acts that further extend on or overwrite sections of the penal code. The penal code and acts are well organized and consistently structured, however, the legal terms and language used are not understandable by people who are not educated in law. This creates an issue for such people who want to conduct research themselves. This is the problem we wish to address. We have partnered with Singapore’s Community Justice Center to obtain data involving citizens requesting for legal assistance. We plan to create a system that can take in the legal predicament and background information from the user’s case. We would then be giving them the section of law that the issue is covered under, previous cases and court proceedings that are like the current case, and finally the relevant acts that are related to the user’s case. This will all be packaged into a custom app to allow it to be accessible to users."
ISYFdigital,2021,20.022.NUSE.PH,Gait Monitoring and Analysis for Parkinson's Disease Patients,"Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra, an area of the brain, leading to shaking, stiffness, and difficulty walking. Parkinson’s patients frequently exhibit the debilitating condition, freezing of gait (FoG), which is when patients cannot move their feet forward despite the intention to walk. Whilst the feet remain in place, the torso still has forward momentum, making falls very common. Several studies have reported methodologies to identify the PD patients at an early stage, such as PD scales and using inertial measurement units (IMU). However, these methods are ineffective as scales are not personalised, and the IMUs are generally big and bulky. In this study, acceleration data from the thigh of PD patients have been put through signal processing algorithms to postulate a generic freeze index, which is then run through multiple support vector machine models to analyse and therefore predict FoG events. The analysis found that vertical and horizontal lateral acceleration were the most accurate at predicting FoG. Ultimately, a small and lightweight prototype was created based on acceleration data from accelerometers placed on the thigh."

SSEF,2022,RO014,Embodied AI for computational perception and understanding of spatial designs,"Semantic Segmentation is a computer vision task used to identify specific regions of interest for virtual agents and autonomous robots or vehicles, specifically by assigning a class to every pixel of a given image. These class allocations require computational perception of nearby pixels, which hence requires very highly detailed algorithms and larger segmentation models to be achieved. The purpose of this project is to gain semantic understanding of the architectural design and layout of Housing Development Board (HDB) apartment interiors and of 3D exterior facades of HDB buildings. Transfer learning algorithms on semantic segmentation models have been employed to understand and analyse these two-dimensional images provided. These models require a lot of carefully annotated data, hence transfer learning on pre-trained models is used to improve the accuracy of the model. Ultimately, it is found that transfer learning with semantic segmentation is an effective way to comprehend the design and layouts of these HDB interiors and exteriors."
SSEF,2022,PH008,An Investigation on the aerodynamics of flight of a hand helicopter,"A simple hand helicopter can be made by attaching rotor blades to one end of a vertical stick. The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is spun above a threshold angular velocity and released — a mechanism of common toys found in toy shops. This study uses computational fluid dynamics to predict the airflow around a hand helicopter from which the lift and drag acting on the hand helicopter’s blades can be obtained. Newton’s Second Law is then applied to find the hand helicopter’s equations of motion. These are solved to predict the helicopter’s trajectory and maximum height. The angle of attack, length of blades and thickness of blades are varied and their effects on the lift coefficient, drag coefficient, lift-off and maximum height are investigated. The findings offer insight into the parameters which will allow a hand helicopter to achieve its optimal maximum height. The conditions required for the hand helicopter to fly stably are also investigated and explained using the Tennis Racket Theorem."

A  potential alternative to traditional treatment would be the use of bacteriophages (phages). Recent years have seen a renewed interest in phages due to their natural abundancy, low cost, rapid replication times and potential for non-intrusive therapy. Here, we explore the possibility of employing phages rather than traditional antimicrobial drugs to treat K. pneumoniae infections. 17 novel phages were isolated from local and overseas sources and purified from K. pneumoniae samples and host range analysis was performed to determine their potential to be used in phage therapy.  ΦBZ was notably found to be able to kill a wide range of 25 unique K. pneumoniae strains. To improve killing against phage-resistant strains, we further investigated the bactericidal efficacy of a novel phage-antibiotic cocktail, consisting of ΦBZ, ΦSP21, ΦFAJ16 and fosfomycin. This combination was shown to work synergistically, markedly decreasing bacterial load by 7.8 log cycles (p < 0.001) at fosfomycin concentration of 512μg/ml compared to treatment with ΦBZ alone after 24h. Our cocktail was able to significantly check the emergence of phage-resistant mutants compared to ΦBZ alone. Hence, our results clearly demonstrate the potential of our novel phage-antibiotic cocktail in treating K. pneumoniae infections in patients who do not respond to conventional antibiotic therapy. "

A novel method for designing membrane filters for water purification is developed using recycled plastic and chitosan derived from shrimp shells. The active material chitosan has conventionally been used for medical applications but has demonstrated potential for nanofiltration. In this work, we successfully modified chitosan to target various types of dyes during filtration. The raw material polyethylene terephthalate is derived from recycled plastic bottles and turned into porous supports. The bio-derived chitosan polymer is modified using various anhydrides to alter its affinity to different types of molecules based on their polarity, before being coated onto the supports to form membrane filters. Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy is used to verify each step of the fabrication process as well as the successful modification of chitosan. Next, the efficiency of filtration is tested using Congo Red, Malachite Green and Methylene Blue dyes to model pollutants. The dye solutions before and after filtration were characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Of the filters tested, those containing unmodified chitosan or chitosan modified with propionic groups demonstrate the highest affinity to highly polar contaminants, removing up to 59.1% of Congo Red dye. Those containing chitosan modified with isobutyryl groups demonstrate the highest affinity to nonpolar contaminants, removing up to 55.1% of Malachite Green dye. This effective performance of our synthesised membranes illustrates the potential of custom-modified chitosan membranes manufactured from eco-friendly sources as highly selective filters for water purification."

SSEF,2023,CO001,Deep Learning Model for the Prediction of Antimicrobial Agents,"In the face of increasing antimicrobial resistance, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have shown great potential as an alternative method to kill or inhibit the growth of microscopic pathogens. As discovering AMPs is costly and time inefficient, deep learning has been proposed to accelerate the process by suggesting potential AMPs before they undergo wet lab validation. PepGAN is one such framework to train a peptide sequence Generator. In this study, we build on PepGAN and substitute our own molecular fingerprint-based XGBoost model as the activity predictor. We use transfer learning to train an activity predictor that identifies peptides effective against the \emph{Enterococcus faecalis}(EF) species of bacteria. We find that the positive dataset passed to PepGAN has a far greater impact on the performance compared to PepGAN's activity predictor, and find that 4843 of the 9937 peptides generated are antimicrobial against the EF strain at or above 70\% confidence level. In future work, we hope to do wet-lab testing to determine the actual efficacy of the suggested peptides."

It has become an invaluable tool in the modern world as it is widely used in CT scanners in hospitals. However, due to limitations in equipment or hazards of high dosage, the dosage that can be safely delivered is limited. This results in reduced image quality. Improving the quality of such low-dose CT scans can not only reduce the potential health risks posed to patients, but it can also reduce the equipment costs and time taken, allowing for CT scans to be utilized much more liberally. In this project, we develop novel deep learning methods for low dose computed tomography using Transformers. Our model, CTransformer is trained on real-world data and extensive experiments are carried out to show that it outperforms all existing traditional methods. It also achieves near state-of-the-art performance on the LoDoPaB low-dose CT challenge, showing this approach has great potential. More importantly, we show that deep learning based reconstruction techniques can function well even with extremely low dosages, with our model achieving a peak-signal-to-noise-ratio of 32.24 and structural similarity index of 0.781 even when 90% of sinograms are masked."

SSEF,2023,SS001,Automated Scanning of Software Packages in Compiled Binaries,"Vulnerabilities in open-source software pose dangers to users because malicious actors can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise software security. To mitigate these dangers, software patches are released to fix such vulnerabilities. However, due to the volume of patches being released, users may miss out certain patches and use a vulnerable version of software unknowingly. We have thus developed a tool to automatically scan for software vulnerabilities and their associated patches in compiled, stripped binary files. Our tool uses three methods: (1) static analysis of constants, (2) emulation of the functions to analyse the output and control flow, and (3) analysis of global memory accesses. We tested this tool on six well-known vulnerabilities, including OpenSSL Heartbleed and Bash Shellshock, across three different architectures (x86, MIPS and ARM). Static analysis successfully detected all the vulnerabilities and their patches, while control flow analysis and memory access analysis had varying success. We found that static analysis is the optimal method of scanning for vulnerabilities since it is fast, simple and applicable to many vulnerabilities and architectures. However, if malicious actors have modified the constants, there is a risk of inaccurate results, so other methods might perform better. Our tool can check if software contains previously disclosed vulnerabilities, preventing hackers from compromising these systems. Our tool can also check if new software releases contain old vulnerabilities. Additionally, it can help analysts better understand stripped functions. This can be applied to other use cases such as discovering new vulnerabilities, improving the overall cybersecurity of open-source projects."
SSEF,2023,RO043,Vessel Trajectory Prediction in Maritime Transportation based on deep learning,"Precise Geolocation data of modern cargo ships allows us to precisely plot a ship’s trajectory. In conjunction with modern machine learning techniques, this enables us to build models which extrapolates the ship’s trajectory. By forecasting the future positions of ships, it allows for the monitoring of maritime traffic, which helps to maintain situational awareness. Such data could also be used to help avoid collision between ships, or to help plan ship paths. In the past decade, models for marine trajectory prediction include sequence to sequence convolutions, long-short term memory networks (LSTM), LSTMs with attention, and most recently a transformer. Given that LSTMs and Transformers are 2 of the most successful sequence to sequence models so far, by combining them we were able to improve on the performance of the best trajectory prediction models. When a DenseNet ran on the transformer output with a skip connection, we achieved a sizable improvement compared to the current best model TrAISformer. To further test the utility of our model, we trained this model on data from Singapore in 2021. We did the same with previous models from literature review and compared their results. Amongst the previous models, TrAISformer performed the best, with an average distance between true position and predicted position of the ship after 3 hours being 1.95 nautical miles. Our model performed approximately 57% better as compared to TrAISformer. Across multiple datasets, we are consistently able to better predict maritime trajectory than previous work."
SSEF,2023,SS024,Interpreting and Evading Visualization-Based Deep Learning Malware Classifiers,"Machine learning has seen increasing usage in the field of cybersecurity, particularly for the classification of malware. Visualization-based techniques have been proposed as a means of binary representation, often being used in deep learning frameworks which rely on architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), often producing high accuracy models. This paper aims to explore the interpretability of such a classifier, using localization maps and adversarial samples to identify areas and elements of the binary that the classifier deems high importance in the classification process. Furthermore, a novel adversarial attack is developed which relies on the insertion of opaque predicates into a malicious binary to evade detection. We show that visualization-based malware deep learning classifiers are easily evaded, with the novel attack having a 100\% evasion rate with an average filesize increase of 0.43452\%. Furthermore, analysis of localization maps show that CNNs are unable to identify regions which contribute to the malicious behaviour of a binary and often incorrectly identify easily modifiable non-executable regions such as null-byte padding as high importance features in the classification process. We thus recommend the discontinuation of use of visualization-based deep learning classifiers due to low interpretability and ease of evasion, contrary to recent research output which claims its robustness."
SSEF,2023,SS020,LEDA: A Lightweight Game Engine using C++ Component-Based Techniques,"Game engines are tools commonly used by software developers to create dynamic applications, containing ready-made functions that clients can use. However, most available game engines have complex user interfaces that use a separate window and have multiple parts. Additionally, many game engines are specialised for specific genres. These functionalities are useful for large projects, but consumes unnecessary processing power and introduces unnecessary complication for smaller projects or demos. We create a novel game engine with a dynamic link library (DLL) structure named LEDA, which allows for increased portability of the engine and ease of linking for smaller projects, as well as providing a greater degree of simplicity for new developers without a separate interface to go through. LEDA taking this structure also allows for direct integration of engine functions in game code, making it useful for beginners learning the interactions between the game engine and logic. The game engine uses the OpenGL library for graphics support and contains multiple systems to support users, including functions for physics, collision detection, and reading input. We also use a component-based composition technique to design game objects, which makes the engine more modular and easier to refactor, supporting continued updates or modification. This engine will provide a more accessible option for newer developers who are beginning to create their own applications without being intimidated by larger, commercial-use game engines."
SSEF,2023,RO032,Longest simple path with Machine Learning,"The longest simple path problem on general undirected graphs is a well-studied NP-Complete problem. It has applications in circuit board design, robotics, and many other fields. Prior approaches consist of using genetic algorithms, heuristic searches, and constraint solvers. In this paper, we attempt to solve this neural combinatorial optimization problem using graph neural networks (GNN). We believe this is the first work to make use of GNNs to find the longest simple path. We generated a custom dataset of graphs and use dynamic programming solvers to find the solution on small randomly generated graphs. We train the neural network on this dataset and combined it with the beam search algorithm to predict the longest simple path. We were able to achieve 99.6\% accuracy on our testing dataset and the graph neural network was able to perform better than some of the best algorithms that were done in the past."
SSEF,2023,RO028,Deep Equilibrium BERT,"Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ) are a class of implicit neural networks that have recently gained attention due to their competitive performance against state of the art deep neural networks while only requiring fixed memory costs irrespective of the effective depth of the network. However, there remains no easily accessible pretrained deep equilibrium language models available to the public. In this paper we develop DEQBert, a novel deep equilibrium implementation of the BERT language model. We base DEQBert on the open-source HuggingFace Transformers library, evaluate its performance against established benchmarks, and publicly release the pretrained weights. Training DEQ language models present unique sets of challenges, and while DEQBert does not match the performance of BERT, we hope that the development of a codebase and pretrained model encourages further exploration and improvement of DEQ language models.

SSEF,2023,RO041,Deep learning model for the diagnosis of exudative pharyngitis,"Background: Telemedicine is firmly established in the healthcare landscape of many countries. Acute respiratory infection is the most common reason for a telemedicine consultation. Throat examination is important to diagnose bacterial pharyngitis, but this is challenging for doctors during a telemedicine consultation. A solution is for patients to upload images of their throat to a web application.

Aim: The aim is to develop a deep learning model for the automated diagnosis of exudative pharyngitis. Thereafter, the model will be deployed online.

Methods: I used 343 throat images (139 with exudative pharyngitis and 204 without pharyngitis) in the study. ImageDataGenerator augmented the training data. Transfer learning (pre-trained on ImageNet data) was used. The convolutional neural network models of MobileNetV3, ResNet50 and EfficientNetB0 were implemented to train the dataset, with hyper-parameter tuning.

Results: All 3 models trained successfully with loss and training loss decreasing, and accuracy and training accuracy increasing with successive epochs. The EfficientNetB0 model achieved the highest accuracy at 95.5%, compared to MobileNetV3 (80.6%) and ResNet50 (76.1%). The EfficientNetB0 model was also able to achieve a high precision (1.00), recall (0.89) and f1-score (0.94).

Discussion: I have trained a deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 that can diagnose exudative pharyngitis. My model was able to achieve the highest accuracy at 95.5% out of all previous studies that used machine learning for the diagnosis of exudative pharyngitis. I have deployed the model on a web application for automated diagnosis of exudative pharyngitis."
SSEF,2023,BE023,Analysing Gait Patterns of Parkinson's Disease patients to predict Freezing of Gait (FoG) using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the substantia nigra, a region in the brain. It causes many hindrances to activities of daily living (ADL). A debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait (FoG), where patients are unable to move forward despite intention of walking. The forward momentum of the torso can often lead to patients falling, causing serious medical consequences. Prior work has explored the use of gait tests, medical questionnaires and inertial measurement units to predict FoG. In this research, work has been done to perform a comprehensive review of various input formats, signal processing algorithms and machine learning algorithms to predict such FoG events. A novel method for image representation via autoscaling and RGB pixelation has been introduced, in addition to raw signal data and the Moore-Bachlin algorithm for Freeze Indices. We find that a 2-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) performs the best on scaled images, attaining state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.50% and sensitivity of 99.65%. We integrate this model into an Android application which can be used by patients and doctors to predict and track freeze events over a period of time. This can help doctors diagnose patients and gauge the severity of the disease, so as to prescribe medication."

This has made research in the political landscape difficult. As such, our research seeks to derive a characteristic formula of those family dynamics through a macro application of graph theory. Through the construction of a family tree of the French royal lineage along with analysis and observation of a large dataset of historical events, a skeleton was developed using key data points within our samples. The skeleton is then refined by including more samples and scenarios, resulting in the distance formula R. It is capable of giving a numerical distance between any person A and B within a family tree, which would determine how closely related they were, and from there able to make predictions for succession or related scenarios. It is found that the formula was able to accurately help break down and shed light on the succession dispute of King Charles IV in 1328, the primary reason for the Hundred Years War between the English and the French. Overall the R distance formula was of good accuracy and has met our research goals. It would be capable of reflecting and simulating historical events with reasonable accuracy, and thus would provide insight into fundamental dynamics within the mediaeval royal families. It is believed that this formula could form the foundation for future more complex and flexible formulas, and thus is a step closer to describing what seemed to be a chaotic phenomenon."

Herein, we discuss the Telemetry, Tracking and Communication subsystem of a Cube-Satellite at Low-Earth Orbit, and propose a novel schema that enables Image Transmission, sending of Telemetry data and tracking of the flight path of the Cube-Satellite. Fragmented packets, a means of robust large data transfer from Antenna to Ground, is used to send Wavelet-Compressed JPEG2000 images, captured on the payload camera, to ground station. Further bit-encoding and error correction is performed, resulting in a robust, efficient and simple means of Satellite image capture."

SSEF,2023,PH022,An Automated Screening System for Trinary Star System Candidates,"The discovery and cataloguing of trinary star systems is of significant interest to the field of astronomy, with implications from stellar system formation dynamics to satellite star capture frequency. However, this generally involves the intensely laborious task of manually analysing photometric data, making large-scale classification difficult. While a few semi-automated algorithms to aid in this task have been developed, they both struggle with noisy data and are closed source, making their application limited. By analysing variations in the Eclipse Timings of known Eclipsing Binaries (EBs) using filtering and signal processing techniques, we develop a noise-resistant semi-automated system to screen EBs for potential trinary companions. We additionally run our system on the Kepler EB Catalogue v3, and detect the presence of 401 trinary star candidates out of a dataset of 2865 stellar systems. Our algorithm allows for rapid processing of EBs, and enables the large-scale identification of trinary stars. Our classification of the dataset, alongside all source code, is available at https://github.com/three-body-analysis/codebase"

SSEF,2023,EY007,Optically and Wirelessly Re-chargeable Buffer Batteries,"Photocapacitors are a type of capacitors that can be wirelessly charged through exposure to electromagnetic radiation. This combines the functions of a solar cell and a capacitor and are cost-effective rechargeable power sources that are compact and basic. This results in a wide range of application. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of 3 novel photosensitive dyes used in Dye-Sensitised Solar Cells (DSSC) while trying to optimise the fabrication of such cells. These dyes are sensitive to red to infrared wavelengths. Photocapacitors are fabricated by depositing the dyes onto a layer of TiO2 on FTO coated glass, before sealing with DN-C07 in MPN electrolyte. Various capacitor properties such as internal voltage discharge, capacitance and maximum open circuit voltage are measured. Capacitance of the cells were measured by applying external current load of 700nA. Ideal fabrication conditions are determined to maximise the open circuit voltage and charge retention. Cells developed using this method utilising dye LF15 can reach up to 0.72V potential difference and retain up to 70% 5 min after removal of light source. LF23 has shown to be able to provide the largest current density when short-circuited. These results are significant improvements from previous works. Sensitivity to infrared radiation allows usage in places impenetrable by visible light such as in internal organs and interior of electronics."

SSEF,2023,BE018,Shielding-Free Signal Noise Suppression in Portable Low-Field MRI,"Portable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (poMRI) setups allow for point-of-care imaging, which can greatly enrich paramedic services. However, these setups are extremely sensitive to external electromagnetic noise. Currently, most poMRIs employ electromagnetic shielding to reduce the external noise, though at the cost of its mobility. This motivates the use of shielding-free techniques. Here we present an approach that uses data recorded from external ambient noise coils to suppress the noise experienced by the primary radio-frequency (RF) receiver coil. Our method boasts a 30-fold noise suppression for individual measurements and a 17-fold average noise suppression for 128 randomly selected samples. Furthermore, our method only requires a calibration time of 56.5 ms, hugely improving on current deep learning methods (which usually require at least 18 minutes to train); thus, allowing for on-the-spot calibration. Our noise suppression method might significantly improve the image quality of poMRI, without the need for a shield."

SSEF,2023,AS009,"Active matter cytometry for high-resolution sizing, sorting of zebrafish larvae","In aquaculture farming, uneven larval growth is often observed and sorting at the early stages is necessary to prevent cannibalism and uneven product size. However, current sorting methods are generally slow, labour-intensive, and inaccurate. Here, we created a novel mechanism called active matter cytometry (AMC), which accurately sizes and sorts zebrafish larvae at the millimeter scale, drawing inspiration from cell cytometry. The AMC performs 3 functions – channeling larvae into tubing, predicting the length of larvae with photomicrosensors, and directing them to the correct sorting point with a solenoid actuator. This design involved the use of 3D printed parts to customize some commercially available components. Our results show that the sensors are capable of predicting the larval length with a median accuracy of 95.6\% as they move headfirst through tubing. When tasked to separate zebrafish larvae born 9 days apart, we observed a 90\% accuracy and larvae remained alive and intact. Our AMC shows great potential to be scaled up for commercial use in aquaculture farms, and could be applied to larvae of various types of fish. Furthermore, it can support laboratory work such as polymerase chain reaction testing in zebrafish. With modifications to the sensing component, we can also utilize our design for high-quality imaging of larvae and make use of machine learning for other classification criteria."
Globecom,2023,23.010.SIT_.CS,A Novel Feature Vector for Windows Malware Detection using Deep Learning,"Dynamic malware analysis, which has been a major field in malware analysis and detection, involves executing the malware in a controlled environment and observing its behavior. Based on dynamic analysis reports, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are extracted as a data source for statistical features, have allowed for effective malware detection. However, existing works neglect certain critical information about the API calls when constructing feature vectors. In this paper, we propose a novel feature vector, taking into account not only API calls and their arguments but also other statistical features such as return values, and global statistics. Due to the diversity of API calls in terms of the number of arguments, we adopt hash functions to construct a fix-sized feature vector, thus facilitating the design and development of machine learning and deep learning models for malware detection. We experiment with various deep-learning models and we adopt a genetic algorithm for parameter tuning to come up with an optimal model for our feature vector. Experiments on a real dataset of $15000$ samples show that our solution outperforms many baseline state-of-the-art malware detectors in various performance metrics such as accuracy, and false positive or false negative rate, thus proving the effectiveness of our feature vector and detection model."
