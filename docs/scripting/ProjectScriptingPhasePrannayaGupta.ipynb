    "The Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Department of NUS High School is a core pillar for the continued development of students in our school. With the Advanced Research Project (ARP) being a major component of our diploma, the RIE department has the immense responsibility to administrate various projects from various students. This especially important given the fact that the school gives students autonomy to participate in multiple projects with mentors from various research institutions under different time periods. However, recent years have shown that there are certain cracks forming in the database system employed by the RIE, which is incredibly problematic in administrating continuation projects, receiving project details and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that our RIE department will benefit from a RDBMS system to manage projects so that they have consistency in Project Details, allowing easier methods to search and sift through projects done by specific students, submit and receive Project Reports, Posters and ISEF/SSEF Forms, and help people get to know more about research done by Seniors and Juniors alike."

    "> <span style=\"background-color:#ffff00\">Rationale behind the above condition: There are certain students who graduated to become teachers in NUS High, for instance Ms Han Shutong who used to teach in NUS High. Owing to the fact that NUS High is aging, we could expect more students to come back to teach, and with that, we have students who were also initially teachers. While it would also make sense for them to create a new teacher account under their new school email, it is also true that their student account will be active for quite a while. Another reason is that many projects are mentored by mentors who are, in fact, students themselves. Examples include projects mentored by PhD Candidates or even NUS Students (which, while uncommon, has happened before and is in the scope of the dataset I am currently assembling).</span>\n",

For instance, my SSEF submission code in 2021, BE018 is the same as Yuan Xi's SSEF submission code in 2023. Yet these projects are completely different. Hence, it is more reasonable to make a Submission be largely defined by a Research Event (eg SSEF 2021, SSEF 2023).\n",
