    "The Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) Department of NUS High School is a core pillar for the continued development of students in our school. With the Advanced Research Project (ARP) being a major component of our diploma, the RIE department has the immense responsibility to administrate various projects from various students. This especially important given the fact that the school gives students autonomy to participate in multiple projects with mentors from various research institutions under different time periods. However, recent years have shown that there are certain cracks forming in the database system employed by the RIE, which is incredibly problematic in administrating continuation projects, receiving project details and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that our RIE department will benefit from a RDBMS system to manage projects so that they have consistency in Project Details, allowing easier methods to search and sift through projects done by specific students, submit and receive Project Reports, Posters and ISEF/SSEF Forms, and help people get to know more about research done by Seniors and Juniors alike."
