STYau,2022,S.T. Yau High School Science Award (Asia),2022-11-16,2022-11-16,Virtual,1,0,,"The **S.T. Yau High School Science Award (Asia)** [YHSA(Asia)] is a research-based competition emphasising innovation, originality, creativity and persistence in research activities. It encourages students and teachers to formulate issues with quantitative precision and scientific rationales, with a view to nurturing students’ passion for scientific discovery, patience in the investigation, and rigour in deliberation. YHSA(Asia) is initiated by Professor Shing-Tung Yau with the following goals:

1. To stimulate innovation, originality and creativity in scientific investigation among secondary school students in Asia.
2. To cultivate young talents in science and technology.
3. To encourage university professors, secondary school teachers and secondary schools to promote research activities.
4. To facilitate cultural exchanges among secondary school students from diverse cultural and educational backgrounds.
5. To establish YHSA(Asia) as a reference for university admission.

In 2019-2021, a total of 541 teams from over 25 countries and regions joined YHSA(Asia), in which 28 teams were recommended to compete with other regional finalists in the YHSA Finale in Beijing and obtained excellent [results](https://yauaward-asia.hk/finale-results). Students have gained invaluable learning and rewarding experiences from the Award competition.

Recently, the 2020 Gold Prize awardee in Mathematics has been accepted as a highly competitive [2021 Research Science Institute](https://www.cee.org/programs/research-science-institute) (RSI) programme collaboratively sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
